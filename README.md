This is my initial draft of a repository of thought and ideas that I work through - mostly related to programming but sometimes other topics like knitting and 
avian creatures and fun fashion or board game trends could rear their sprightly heads.

I've put off writing a blog for a long time - in part out of stage fright and in part out of laziness.

Eventually I will host this content in a more dynamic way but to start I'll just make the posts and track the footfalls of sometimes focused and sometimes errant thought.

I hope these posts provide

- me a vehicle for formulating and exploring new concepts and conjectures
- others an opportunity to find something valuable and leave the rest
- a fun log. as literature students, artists and programmers I think we all appreciate the value of a record as a source of insight.

All truth you may find here comes from the heavens and all lies are my own. (:
