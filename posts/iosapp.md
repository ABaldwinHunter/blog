# My first IOS app

My first project is to make a very simple IOS app.

## Why you may ask?

There are many things that can only be done via an app. For instance, regulate and filter calls and messages - I assume.

I actually don't even know if that's possible.

Which brings me to the second objective:

Learn something radically new.

There are many types of learnings. I had a friend once in college who pointed out that while many of our contemporary collegiate fellows balked at intro class
conscription required by their elected course of study, he relished the 101 curriculum because it typically had the highest ROI for time learning about a subject.
For instance, in my Introduction to Microeconomics class I learned about probably 50 or 80% of the core ideas in the field. An economics PhD student goes incredibly deep on a single
topic - which can be beautiful and intriguing - but typically requires increasing amounts of engagement to yield the same level of insight and new knowledge as an introductory or intermediate course.

That's how I sometimes feel about ruby and rails. I'm pretty far from the PhD level of my rails knowledge (side note what would a PhD in rails look like? a 40 page essay
on naming conventions and why `t.belongs_to` is an alias for `t.references` in active record migrations?)

But I've learned enough that sometimes developing feels rather rote - particularly in a craft that rewards coding uniformity with increased development speed and
instant familiarity for newcomers to a codebase.

And so here I am. Excited to be in an unknown land.

## The app:

Surrender.

Ever have a time when you desperately wanted to avoid a number on your phone but not delete or block it forever? What if you could sign up for an app that let you, possibly
with the caveat that you'd pay it if you decide to unlock access to number for some amount of time.

As a long term product here, one awesome aspect is that this product is actually useful IMO. it's not so much not hearing from someone or not calling them that can be hard in - say -
the gut wrenching weeks post break up where you feel affirmed in your passive decision never to try herioin because supposedly the withdrawal feels similar - but rather it's the constant waiting and resistance to an option that's a click away. It's exhausting. Constraints are a rarely requested or appreciated blessing. As we learn to become independent adults, part of our job taking care of ourselves is finding ways to impose compassionate and healthy restraints. `Surrender` (name in flux) could be a simple useful tool.

I could not find any other app quite like this out there. There are some that rename a number of a contact in your phone - but what beleaguered star crossed unrequited Dante doesn't
know their beatrice's number by heart while that person rests on the pedestal of our own creation?

Also, it can be just as terrible and distracting to get a message from such a Beatrice. Sure, your ego feels on top of the world for a bit - and whatever chemical reaction explodes when you rested in your beloved's arm and eye and speech begins to zip at the first brush of contact - like smelling coffee in the morning before you drink it. But, like the heroin analogy it's a precipitous fall after. And it gets in the way of healing.

Also, WONDERING if that call or text or message is coming is an agony. Although I'll always maintain that our phones don't quite give us the true connection we feel in the flesh and blood presence of our friends and family, they do provide access to instant electronic communication - that makes it feel like we're sitting with our backs pressed up against a closed door with our lover's back against ours on the other side.

Making it impossible for that human to reach you (they won't know you've soft blocked their calls and messsages - and you won't either until the end, when you can see a log),
gives us the freedom from wonder and worry and hope. Desperation is hope in the wrong things. Surrender is about letting go so that we can find ways to put our hope and energy in things that empower us.

The only glaring product concern with this pricing model so far is that the interests of the app and user are somewhat misaligned, in that the app only earns money when a user in a moment of weakness asks to see their logs. Maybe it could cost $1.99 to sign up and the app could donate all proceeds to a fund to save animal habitats around the world.

Maybe the habitat of some cool bird that has an amazing weird mating ritual - like the [bower bird], which builds an elaborate platform to perform a mating dance for its woo-ees.

## What I hope to learn

How to make a simple iOS app of any kind. What permissions ios apps can have available (_can_ you mess with someone's numbers?). what are these coca pods that aren't edible?


## The plan

- start with an ios tutorial and make a v basic app of any kind
- try to get access to contacts in a phone
- make a flow that lets a user block and unblock a number
- make a flow that accepts user credit card info (maybe via stripe?)
- try it out

## progress (updates forthcoming)
